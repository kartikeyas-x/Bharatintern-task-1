# Bharat-Intern_task-1_House-Price_prediction

## Introduction
This repository contains the code for a machine learning model that predicts house prices using linear regression. The model is trained on the "USA_Housing.csv" dataset.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Installation
To run the code, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you need to install the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip: pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file, `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb`, using Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run each cell in the notebook to execute the code and see the results.
4. The notebook contains step-by-step explanations of the code and the model evaluation metrics.

## Results
The model is trained using linear regression and achieves good predictions for house prices. The evaluation metrics used are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics provide insights into the accuracy of the model's predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is "USA_Housing.csv". It contains information about average area income, average area house age, average area number of rooms, average area number of bedrooms, area population, and the corresponding house prices.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the implementation of a linear regression model for house price prediction. By analyzing the dataset and training the model, accurate predictions can be made based on the provided features.

Feel free to explore the code and make improvements for your specific use cases!
